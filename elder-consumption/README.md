## Low-cost leisure and the hysteresis of habitus: An inquiry on elderly leisure in China

This project uses a nationally representative data from China to look at the determinants of elder's consumption. The central point of focus is age, and the socio-historical context in the age gaps. I work with Dr. Aurelien Boucher on this project.

Technically, this is my personal try to use package Statamarkdown to integrate functionalities of Stata with R.

### Abstract 
This article investigates into the economic scarcity and social context that have shaped the leisure activities of Chinese elderly consumers through the theory of practice. It aims to demonstrate that elderly in China are less eager to spend money on their leisure and travel activities due to not only present constraints but also a hysteresis of their habitus. A micro-level ethnographic observation and a national survey analysis together would underline how elderly generations grew up under the Maoist period draw the frontier between necessary, desirable and excess consumption. By addressing this matter, this article would challenge the oversimplified justification for a highly potential grey market in China, as well as highlight some key social symptoms in the reform era.
