## Low-cost leisure and the hysteresis of habitus: An inquiry on elderly leisure in China

This project uses a nationally representative data from China to look at the determinants of elder's consumption. The central point of focus is age, and the socio-historical context in the age gaps. I work with Dr. Aurelien Boucher on this project.

Technically, this is my personal try to use package Statamarkdown to integrate functionalities of Stata with R. The project uses Stata for data preparation and modeling, wheras the EDA with visualizations and MCA is done with R.
