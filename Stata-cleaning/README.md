## Background
In 2016, the Medicare program began to phase in patient level criteria for long-term acute care hospitals (LTCHs).  Under the new patient criteria, a LTCH would be eligible to receive its full prospective payment upon discharge of the patient if the case met the following criteria:

•	Immediately prior to admission to the LTCH, the patient was discharged from a hospital paid under the hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS); and 

•	While at the IPPS hospital immediately preceding LTCH admission, the patient spent 3 or more days in an intensive care unit (ICU).
For cases that do not meet these criteria, LTCH receives payment lower than its full prospective payment.

## Task  
Write a program in Stata that answers the following questions:

•	What percent of cases discharged from a LTCH in 2016 met the new criteria?

## Deliverable
A [stata do file](https://github.com/lt2710/Pet-projects/blob/master/Stata-cleaning/Stata_data_preparation.do) to produce the desired calculation
